                        Currently, I am in the process of exploring various fields. One of my main interests is web development, and I am trying on acquiring the necessary skills to undertake exciting projects in this area. I have tried to gain some proficiency in HTML and CSS and am currently expanding my knowledge to include JavaScript and other frontend frameworks, with the intention of eventually delving into backend <br>
                        Being also interested in graphic designing, I am currently honing my skills with Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, as well as experimenting with Canva.<br>

                        Apart from these technical pursuits, I find joy in dance and drawing, which serve as refreshing outlets for me.<br>

            <p class="project">We worked on an awesome project together for a competition called Ardugem, which was part of the General Championship 23 at IIT Bhubaneswar. Our project is a game development project based on Arduino. It's a platformer game where the character needs to jump over obstacles that come in the way. It was a fun group project that we all enjoyed working on. Do check it out!</p>
